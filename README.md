## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The application follows a modern full-stack architecture leveraging the Cloudflare ecosystem.

*   **Frontend:** A React single-page application (SPA) built with Vite provides a rich, interactive user experience.
*   **Backend:** A Hono-based API runs on a Cloudflare Worker, handling business logic and data requests.
*   **Data Storage:** A single `GlobalDurableObject` is used as the primary data store, providing a simple yet powerful persistence layer for user and school data.
*   **Type Safety:** Shared TypeScript types between the frontend and backend ensure end-to-end type safety and reduce runtime errors.
